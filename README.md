# skeleton

## Description

This collection of files makes up "skeleton", a tiny "framework" which
allows you to quickly develop small or large web applications.

We don't like to call it a framework, since it is much less than that.

## Installation

  * Put the code somewhere on a webserver that supports `.htaccess` files
  * Point your DocumentRoot (or equivalent) to ./webroot
  * If you ignored the first instruction, make sure to somehow rewrite all requests to handler.php
  * Create Config.php and Config_Routes.php (samples can be found in ./config)
  * Create a database (import database.sql which can be found in ./config)
  * Run `composer.phar install`, residing in `lib/external/packages/


Documentation can be generated by running these commands:

    php lib/external/packages/vendor/sami/sami/sami.php update util/generate/documentation.php
    ln -s ../store/documentation/ webroot/documentation

It is a bad idea to have this symlink in place while in production. Please don't do it.

## Features

  * Hardly any.
